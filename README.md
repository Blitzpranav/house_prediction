## Project Overview

In this project, we will:

- Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict house prices.
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare the data.
- Analyze the dataset through exploratory data analysis.
- Train and evaluate different machine learning models.
- Choose the best model and fine-tune its hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Dataset

We will be using the 'house_price_prdiction' dataset for this project. The dataset contains various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more, as well as the corresponding sale prices. You can download the dataset from the provided link.
